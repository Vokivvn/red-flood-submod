#LEADER DESCRIPTIONS#
ORE_DESC_MENU:0 "The advent of the civil war had shown all parties that the military districts had been too inefficient. From these conditions was born the Orenburg military district, led by Alexander Dutov and his autonomous band of Cossacks. Meant to be a neutral force, Dutov threw in his lot with Kolchak during the conflict. Following the crushing of Kazakh protests, Alash parties started to actively oppose Dutov. The situation became worse following the famine of 1932-33 which led to a Pro-Communist Peasants revolt. While it seems that the troubles of the Orenburg Military District are largely over, it shall be seen if the vultures circling the nation will make themselves known."
POLITICS_ALEX_DUTOV_DESC:0 "Alexander Dutov has plentiful experience commanding cossack regiments, giving him the skills necessary to govern the Orenburg Cossacks. Dutov has two simple tasks: keep the Orenburg Territory under Russian control, and kill anyone who stands in his way. Being a hardened Russian military man, Dutov is glad to oblige on both accounts."

ore.1.t:0 "An Anonymous Letter"
ore.1.d:0 "\"Ilyich, you've got a letter.\" Dutov looked up and thanked the man, taking the wrinkled envelope from his hands. He'd recieved his fair share of letters in his years as Orenburg's leader, both positive and negative. It was always an interesting surprise to guess which type it was, and although he preferred the former, a quick scan of the contents revealed that this time it would be the latter. \n\n\"To the dishonorable Alexander Ilyich Dutov, may your organs rot in your body. For too long the tyrannical Russian state has suppressed the Kazakh people, the workers, and many others, while you serve as the hand that holds the whip. You are the embodiment of evil, only bested by those who puppet you in Moscow. You are an agent of oppression enforcing an unjust hierarchy onto all peoples under your boot, and I cannot wait until the day your rule comes crumbling down and your corpse is dragged through the streets.\" \n\nAs Dutov finished reading through the verbal assault, he crushed the letter up and tossed it away. He was no stranger to demeaning messages, and each time the small sting grew less and less. At this point they had almost no effect on the man, for it was so normalized in his psyche. There was no reason to lose sleep over one man's anger, for after all:"
ore.1.a:0 "\"What can one man do?\""

ore.2.t:0 "Righteous Disobedience"
ore.2.d:0 "Alexei Ivanovich Dyomin shifted his coat, the sweat seeping through despite the light smattering of snow falling from above. Ataman Dutov's speech infront of Orenburg was very important, especially in these turbulent times. This meant that his job as bodyguard was invaluable now more than ever, which lead to frustrations when Dutov wished to have his guard stand in the background of the stage, in order to promote a more \"peaceful and welcoming\" feeling for the crowd. His foolish wish to appeal to the common man was a huge breach of security protocols, but Alexei didn't want to disobey a direct command from his superior officer. \n\nAs the speech started, Alexei tried to ponder ways in which he could still protect the Ataman in a way that would be more discrete than usual, even if it had the downside of making Dutov appear more vulnerable. After a short period of deliberation, he realized he could attempt to blend into the crowd, and although he would be abandoning his post in technicality, he felt that the safety of the Ataman stood at a higher priority than simple orders. With his mind made up, Alexei chose to..."
ore.2.a:0 "Follow his orders"

ore.6.t:0 "A Lidless Eye"
ore.6.d:0 "Alexei scanned the crowd, time and time again. Nothing moved out of the ordinary, nobody was suspicious, and his eyes started to water. He was limiting his blinking to an inhuman minimum in order to keep better surveillance, and it showed. The cold wind blowing snow against his pupils, the sweat freezing on his face, all of it felt like God himself was testing Alexei, and for naught. Nothing was happening, and nothing would happen. Dutov was right that this event would be a peaceful one, and Alexei blinked again. \n\nBut as he opened his eyes, he caught a glimpse of a reflection being tucked into a jacket. Maybe a gun? Alexei's eyes shot wide open as he focused solely on the man awkwardly shuffling around with his pockets, and his suspicions mounted tenfold when the man started walking towards the stage. The man locked eyes with Alexei's frozen watchmen, and he made a mad dash towards the stage.\n\n\"Ilyich!\", screamed Alexei at full sprint. \"Get down!\" The man leaped onstage, brandishing a grenade with the pin already pulled. In a split second deliberation, Alexei knew what must be done, and as he tackled the suicide  bomber to the floor, he let his eyes rest one final time, safe with the fact that his job had been fulfilled."
ore.6.a:0 "A flash, then dark"

ore.7.t:0 "In The Peaceful Snow"
ore.7.d:0 "As Alexei weaved through the dense crowd, doubts raced across his mind, doubts which he quickly snuffed as simple paranoia induced by stress. He had a job to do which required his upmost attention, and any distractions would be disasterous to the safety of the Ataman, and thus the nation of Orenburg as a whole. He alone stood between Hell and Heaven, as the guardian of life and death. \n\nAlexei's slow shuffle through the powdersnow was impeded by the jostling of the crowd, and more often than once he had been blocked from any movement for precious seconds, a risk that he could not afford to take. As he continued surveying the area, he noticed a man infront of him check over his shoulder before moving towards the stage. Alexei, the vigilant guardian he was, flung himself forward, engaging the mystery man in a chase. The Ataman's face was surprised at this disturbance, and when he turned around to find Alexei missing, his fate was already sealed. \n\nThe man lept onto the stage and into Dutov, before a blinding explosion with the brightness of the Sun threw shrapnel across the crowd. Alexei fell face-down into the same soft snow that had kept him still, his conciousness knocked out from him. The bloody pulp that used to lead Orenburg sizzled, as the snow kept falling as though nothing had happened."

ore.4.t:0 "The Battle of Orenburg"
ore.4.d:0 "With General Dutov's death, his worst fears have been realized. Orenburg - the city and the district both - are in chaos. A chain of explosions rattled the city early this morning with a series of massive hollow booms, and bands of Kazakh partisans, pre-positioned in workhouses and factory dormitories or packed into leased-out flophouses, flooded out into the city. Some groups are barely controlled, but other bands display uniform weaponry and clear signs of training as they move to seize strategic points throughout the city and the surrounding countryside. Gunfire echoes through Orenburg as the insurgents trade fire with paramilitary police units. The citizens have vanished, huddling in their homes and hoping to avoid stray bullets, or else hunkering down with what arms they possess to defend their own property. However, something is amiss in this attempt at a while coup. Messages have gone out, missives dispatched by an anonymous writer claiming to be a general officer of the Orenburg Russian Army, to the garrisons surrounding the city. The missives order the troops to assemble and immediately march on critical positions, doubtlessly putting them into direct conflict with the rebels. But with the source of these missives unknown and their authority dubious at best, the officers are quarreling over the proper response. It remains to be seen how many, if any, of the garrison commanders will march If enough of them move quickly, their regular troops will no doubt crush the irregular partisans. A partial or piecemeal response from the army will likely hand victory to the rebels and traitors - but with Dutov dead and Orenburg in chaos, it is a mystery who would have both the means and motive to arrange the failure of the revolt."
ore.4.a:0 "And so it seems, that Kirghiz separatists shall celebrate after all."
ore.4.b:0 "Maybe it's the mysterious Russian plotters who should drink champagne?"

ore.5.t:0 "Fly Like A Phoenix"
ore.5.d:0 "The deafening roar of a crowd is thrown to the ears of Nikolay Trubetskoy, intellectuals across the cities of Orenburg and national minorities cheer happily as Dutov's regime disintegrates into ash, and a Phoenix rises in it's place - the proclamation of Eurasia rises the hopes of a new future under a reimagined Russia, under the ideal of an Eurasianist concept."

Confidential sources tell me that he remains sympathetic to democracy, so it is very likely that could be undermining the authority of the other generals to restore the Republic.

Of course, one of the other Russian warlords was unlikely: as a possible ally, he was more useful alive than dead. The attack was dirty and improvised, the sort of amateur effort an anarchist might attempt. The Kazakh Separatists were the obvious first suspect - he was going to order his men to sweep every corner of his domain to find the attacker. Even if he had to upturn all of Orenburg in the process."

Much of the machinery had grown worn and outdated in the chaos of the Revolution and the malaise that followed, and perennial corruption cut into both profits and investment budgets. If Dutov was to salvage the situation, no part of the industrial network could be left untouched. He'd need to build new factories, assemble new machines, punish the corrupt, and even find ways to encourage the workers to put in some actual effort."

Getting money from Kolchak was out of the question, so the only ones capable of funding such a project were the Orenburg bourgeoisie.

There is much to be done to improve the performance of the Orenburg Army. Purging inadequate officers, replacing obsolete equipment, reorganizing units, drafting superior battle plans, and preparing to manage rebellion."

It can't be to wish me a full recovery” Dutov thought, once again grabbing his letter opener..."
