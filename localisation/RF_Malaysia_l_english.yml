#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
POLITICS_SHENTON_THOMAS_DESC:0 "Sir Thomas Shenton Whitelegge Thomas is an old and experienced member of the British colonial service and had briefly worked as governor of Nyasaland before events in East Asia forced a career change. The collapse of the British Raj saw him be moved to the Strait settlements in Malaya, before being quickly implemented as governor of the new Government of British Malaya. While this was a event that Shenton would have liked to avoid in fear of causing native resistance, events had had overtaken him and in 1936 Shenton has finally got a solid grip over the organisation of Malayan affairs. While there is resistance from not only native independence movements but also from old white settlers and rulers that want one of their own in charge and not a native londoner. However Shenton pays these critics little attention for there are always more pressing issues at hand and he, as always just like in Nyasaland, deals with them quickly."

#IDEAS#
MAL_economic_downturn:0 "Economic Downturn"
MAL_economic_downturn_desc:0 "When the London Stock Exchange crashed in 1931, Singapore and Malaya were soon to follow. There dependence on Britain as their main export hub and integration in the global economy that had been shattered caused the Malayan economy to enter freefall. While it has been many years since the crash and the Malayan economy has begun to improve, it will take many more years for Malaya to fully recover."

MAL_communist_resurgence:0 "Nanyang Communist Insurgence"
MAL_communist_resurgence_desc:0 "Founded in 1927 as a joint cooperation between the Chinese CPC, the Zheltorossiyan RSDRP, and several pre-existing native trade unions, the Nanyang Communist Society is the vanguard of leftist movements across South-East Asia. Its membership being in the thousands with multiple chapters in Malaya, Siam, Borneo, the Dutch East Indies, and the Philippines. While believed to had been a glorified trade union cooperative at first, they had been executing more aggressive tactics as of lately. Colonial patrols had been reported missing, factories sabotaged with warehouses burnt down, and clashes in the streets between workers and the authority are commonplace. It is undeniable that the communist influence is spiraling out of control and if left unchecked, revolution will happen."

MAL_centralisation_issues:0 "Centralisation Issues"
MAL_centralisation_issues_desc:0 "Throughout the twentieth century Malaya had multiple governors with different ideas on how to manage the colony in its office, going through multiple different waves of centralisation followed by decentralisation. As of now, the local governorate opted to leave the colony decentralised, cooperating with the local sultans and turning a blind eye towards their policies for pragmatic reasons. The Colonial Office back in London however, has been aggressively urging the colony to centralise under a single equal union, and ever since the lost of the British Raj, became desperate to cling onto their last major foothold in Asia. If Shenton Thomas failed to comply to London's demands, they will take matters into their own hands."
