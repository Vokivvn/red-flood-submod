worldnews.1.t:0 "Noskereich - The Lost Freedom"
worldnews.1.d:0 "German communist Writer Bruno Apitz recently published a book called \"Lost Freedom\". In this book, the German Revolution failed due to the purge of Gustav Noske, a social democrat infamous for his support of the counterrevolution. With the help of the military and the capitalists, Noske transformed Germany into an authoritarian-militaristic state. \"Lost Freedom\" follows a young German's struggle against his own regime supported by comrades from anarchist Iberia and Connolly's socialist Ireland. The story hinted that USA, France and the Russian Republic are in a Pact, while Great Britain has fallen under the rule of ultranationalists due to the loss of Ireland and several colonies. In the end, the main character, together with his comrades, overthrew the regime and freed Germany. Due to the prominent role of Noske, the book was nicknamed \"Noskereich\". It received good reviews by socialist medias, claiming that it would show the horror that would be a counter-revolutionary Germany. However, all reviews, regardless of political affiliation could not help but notice that the alternative history Apitz presents is very far streched and hardly believable. The author responded to that criticism by stating that he had not intended to be fully realistic. But he also jokingly added that this could have happened in an \"Alternate Timeline\"."

worldnews.2.d:0 "Pan-Asian author, Buddhist-socialist thinker and ex-Imperial Army officer Ishiwara Kanji published his controversial new novel \"To Live Another Day: The Final Battle\". The story is about the love tragedy between a Japanese soldier and a Chinese girl during the \"Final War\" between the east and west. \nThe background of the story is the most eye-catching part of the work. In China, Prince Sengge Rinchen was killed by a British rocket in the Battle of Zhangjiawan in on 18 September 1865, resulting Empress Dowager Cixi's Xinyou Coup in November failed and the success of \"Qixiang Restoration\" that effectively turned China into an industrialized constitutional monarchy.

Britain and France tightened their grips over their colonies, while Russian turned to a reactionary theocratic monarchy. American democracy was toppled by a coalition of white supremacists and industrial magnates led by Henry Ford, creating a technocratic racist empire."

worldnews.4.d:0 "In order to curb the \"Yellow Peril\", the Big Four strengthened their alliance against China and Japan, who formed the \"Asian Mutual Aid Union in response. \nWhen the \"Final War\" between the East and West soon broke out, the entire Eurasia became the largest battlefield in history where dozens of millions perished in decades of bloodshed. A variety of fictional weapons were adopted on the battlefield, including unmanned aircrafts, biochemical weapons and energy beam cannons. The title \"To Live Another Day\" refers to the last sentence of the protagonist's closest comrade before the atomic anniliation, when both sides launched their secret weapons in a desperate attempt to break the decade-long stalemate.\nThe book was criticised for radical racism and horrific descriptions of atrocities in the name of racial justice. Ishiwara responded that such catastrophe could happen in another reality, as \"they will never treat us equally no matter how successful we are, unless we stand united against their superiority.\""

news.intro.d:0 "In 1905 Russia achieved a pyhrric victory in the Russo-Japanese War, strengthening the monarchy until Tsar Nicholas II was assassinated in 1911. This set a chain of events in motion that led to WWI breaking out in 1913 after the 2nd Balkan War drew Austria-Hungary and Russia to blows. The Triple Entente and Central Powers fought for years but eventually the war fizzled out, the French Army collpased, Russia fell into chaos at the death of Tsar Alexei II and Spartakist uprisings in Germany deposed the Monarchy. Britain could only look on in horror as the continent tore itself apart, its Empire also grew increasingly unstable. In the East Japan snatched up a colonial empire - overextending itself in the process - the USA, dismayed at the state of the world, doubled down on its isolationism. \nHowever, in the years since the end of the war, a new movement has swept the face of Europe: Accelerationism. This highly artistic and chauvinist political manifestation of extreme modernism emerged on the global scene after Italian radicals seized the city of Fiume in 1919, and has been a thorn in the side of Marxists, Monarchists and Moderates alike ever since. The growth of Accelerationism produced a crescendo in 1934 when after decades of instability, France fell under the influence of its own Accelerationist movement. Now the leader of the Avant Guard State - Antonin Artaud - prepares France to bring the world into the future, kicking and screaming if it must. As the stars align once more, the stage is set for a new Great War, one which will stain the world red."

news.333.desc:0 "The world has been shaken today, as a German chicken farmer named Heinrich Himmler has apparently found an entrance to what he calls \"Agartha\", an underground advanced civilization living inside of Earth. It appeases that our planet is in fact hollow, and that these Agarthans have been living inside the Earth for many millennia, using a force known as Vril to develop strange abilities which can only be described as supernatural. Himmler's discovery has left scientists around the world baffled, as by all logic this should not be possible, yet it clearly appears that humanity may not be the only sentient creatures living on, or in this case, under the Earth's surface."

This crucial moment is our chance! We shall paint a great image over Britain! We will paint with our bombs, with our cars, and with their own blood. We stand to protect the oppressed masses of the world against the rotting corpse that is Anglo culture! The heart of this cancer, the bastion of the intellectually dull and meandering bourgeoisie, is LONDON! Our troops are ready to fight! The rituals are complete, so let the invasion begin!\""

news.334.desc:0 "Today, a prominent poet and the great Vođa of south slavs Tin Ujevic made a firey speech in Belgrade which has shaken all of Europe. The country of Yugoslavia, which as of now owns every corner of balkan peninsula, was declared by the great leader to be the one and true heir of ancient Aryan civilization. Ujevic also announced that the nation will soon begin the \"conquest of all rightfully slavic lands\". Some view this development as a foolery, given the geographic positioning of self-proclaimed \"northerners\" compared to the western slavic and eastern slavic countries, but many fear what the true ambitions and capabilities of yugoslavians might be."
