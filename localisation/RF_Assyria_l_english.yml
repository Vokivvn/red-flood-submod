ASY_DESC_MENU:0 "Created by retreating Caucasus Army forces of the Russian Empire, Assyria is a state dominated by Russians, Assyrians, and other Christians, while non-Christian demographics have practically little representation. Despite it's weakness as a structure of state, Assyria is peaceful, and developing well. Its Patriarch, Shimun XXI Eshai, protects his people's nationhood that they were taken away from by Ottoman forces, and hopefully it will stay that way."

ASY_adobt_greater_assyria_plan:0 "Adopt Greater Assyria Plan"
ASY_adobt_greater_assyria_plan_desc:0 "To hell with consistency! Why shouldn’t we conquer the lands once controlled by the fathers of the great Assyrian people?! We ruled there once and we shall do so again! This is what Assyria has been destined for since the days of old! The efforts of our forefathers shall not have been in vain!"

ASY_agha_petros_introduces_the_martial_law_desc:0 "Following the death of the Patriarch, the ascension of the next one seemed rather likely. Few had predicted outside of some potential protests by some bookclub no one had heard of before that there’d be much going on in Assyria. But this view has proven itself to be especially naive. Following the death of Benyamen, the general Agha Petros had launched a coup before a new patriarch could be elected. The goals of the coup are as of yet somewhat vague and unclear, but to prevent any potential resistance to the coup by oligarchs and more militant religious groups, Petros has declared Martial Law in Assyria to ensure the stability of the coup. Even if a few eggs must be cracked in doing so."
ASY_air_corp:0 "Assyrian Air Corps"
ASY_air_corp_desc:0 "Much has changed since 2000 BC. Things thought impossible then are everyday things now. Perhaps most notably is the plane. The ability to soar above the heads of the foe and fight from there gives us a great advantage. One that we cannot be left out of."
ASY_army_of_descendants_of_ashurbanipal:0 "Army of Descendants of Ashurbanipal"
ASY_army_of_descendants_of_ashurbanipal_desc:0 "The Assyrian nation is famous for, if nothing else, it’s military history. We were the ones who sacked and conquered Jerusalem! We were the ones who campaigned in Egypt! The nations of the early world trembled when they heard our names! The fear and respect that we are owed shall return. Let us make our armies something that all shall tremble in the face of!"
ASY_assyrian_church_preserves_its_status:0 "Assyrian Church Preserves Its Status"
ASY_assyrian_church_preserves_its_status_desc:0 "Rule by theocratic monarchs and oligarchs has not exactly given the Assyrian nation much. Many mistakes were made under the rule of authoritarian moguls. Mistakes that must never be repeated. That being said, we cannot sideline the Assyrian Church. It is one of the staple institutions that gives the Assyrian nation its pride, strength and unity. Let us dismantle the anti-democratic institutions of old but move to preserve the church. We may be a democracy, but in doing so we shall not become Godless."
ASY_attract_foreign_assyrians:0 "Reunite The Diaspora"
ASY_attract_foreign_assyrians_desc:0 "“Hey! Assyrian! Haven’t you heard? Your homeland yearns for you!” This is the slogan that we shall be that all Assyrians across the world, wherever they may be, shall see. Many Assyrians fled from their homeland to escape the political turmoil that came with the division of the Ottoman Empire following the Great War. But now, after so many years! The Assyrian nation has at last returned! Our people can breathe a sigh of relief and return to the land that they always belonged to!"
ASY_back_to_the_nineveh_plains:0 "Back to The Nineveh Plains"
ASY_back_to_the_nineveh_plains_desc:0 "Thousands of years ago, the Assyrian state was centered, not in the mountainous, rugged landscape of South-Eastern Anatolia, but the plains of Nineveh along the Tigris and Euphrates river. Now that these lands are back under our firm control, it is only logical that we return the centre of our administration there as well."
ASY_british_advisors:0 "British Advisors"
ASY_british_advisors_desc:0 "The British Empire is called the Empire on which the sun never sets for a good reason. If the British could have conquered vast swathes of land like India or reached from the mouth of the Nile to the turbulent Cape of Good Hope they must be doing something right. Let us learn from the Anglo and learn as much as we can from these formidable conquerors."

ASY_build_hakkari_urmia_railway_desc:0 "Due to the rugged terrain of a historically underdeveloped region, the infrastructure of our nation is poor to say the least. In order to fix this, we shall connect our country and its population. A great railway shall be built to connect our greatest cities!"
ASY_buy_weapons:0 "Buy Weapons"
ASY_buy_weapons_desc:0 "On our own, it is unlikely that we will be able to soon have enough weapons to supply our men. So let us turn outside. Let us purchase what we need from the rest of the world and take a great leap forward for our military!"
ASY_censor_the_press:0 "Censor The Press"
ASY_censor_the_press_desc:0 "A most disturbing occurrence has sprung up across Assyria. With the advent of democracy in the country, the press had been freed of all restrictions. This has caused a renaissance, of sorts, to spring up within Assyria, as radicals such as Councilists, Accelerationist sympathisers and Kurdish separatists have taken to journalism and writing to spread and promote their views among the populace. Many within our government have been neutral to the movements, citing the fact that any functioning democracy should not have a problem with political dissidence. What these naive idealists fail to realise however is that these movements could lead to a grave threat to the Assyrian nation. Whether it may mean our country falling to the schmeing Councilists, the lunatics that make up the Accelerationist movement or the Kurdish Separatists who seek to tear Assyria apart! To kill the baby in the cradle, we must move to censor such radical opposition members. Not necessarily imprison and directly suppress them but certainly take the steps necessary to save Assyria from certain collapse!"
ASY_church_school_network:0 "Church School Network"
ASY_church_school_network_desc:0 "While the Bible is surely holy and in many ways infallible, we could not call ourselves good Christians if we did not study and promote the study of the Bible so that we may understand the teachings of the patriarchs that came before us and perhaps most importantly of the Lord, God and his son on Earth."
ASY_crush_the_kurdish_uprising:0 "Crush The Kurdish Uprising"
ASY_crush_the_kurdish_uprising_desc:0 "Opportunism in times of crisis and social upheaval is of course to be expected. And unfortunately, the establishment of a Republic in Assyria has been no exception. Following the imposition of Martial Law, Kurdish tribes in the countryside and even some small cities have risen up to try and achieve independence."
ASY_destroy_the_internal_opposition:0 "Destroy The Interal Opposition"
ASY_destroy_the_internal_opposition_desc:0 "To some, it may appear to be a hypocritical action. How could us, those who wish to represent the Lord God and set an example for all other Christian by purging those from our country merely for disagreeing with us? There is to be sure a point to be made in that sense. But let us not forget that ultimately us, and us alone can guide the flock that is Assyria to the path of God. We cannot let political distractions… distract… people. What is damnation for political matters on Earth in the face of Eternal happiness in Paradise?"
ASY_distribute_wealth_of_disloyal_tribal_leaders:0 "Distribute Wealth of Disloyal Tribal Leaders"
ASY_distribute_wealth_of_disloyal_tribal_leaders_desc:0 "We are, first and foremost, the Conservative party. Our very nature benefits the many Tribal chieftains and leaders scattered across our country. It is already in their interest to vote for us, to support us and to stand with us! Therefore, those of them that dare speak out against us can only have their own interests in mind. Not the interests of the Assyrian state. If they will not change their views then we shall make an example of them. We shall take away their power and their wealth and give it to the more sympathetic tribes men, so others may err on the side of caution and loyalty towards us."
ASY_elections:0 "Elections"
ASY_elections_desc:0 "With the final decision on the Kurdish Question being made, Assyria is now ready for it’s elections to begin. There are two main political parties now dominating the Assyrina political scene. The Conservative GAD, led by Yusuf Malek and the Centre-left GSA, led by Freydun Atturaya."
ASY_end_of_the_caucasian_tatars_freedom:0 "End of The Free Caucasian Tatars"
ASY_end_of_the_caucasian_tatars_freedom_desc:0 "We cannot blame the Azeri’s desire for freedom in the South, given what its people have endured. But we cannot let pity stand in the way of the destiny of Russia and her empire. Thus, we must march south and take our rightful lands for the sake of Russia!"
ASY_expand_the_conscriptions:0 "Expand Conscription"
ASY_expand_the_conscriptions_desc:0 "Let us be frank. The position our armies are in are not the greatest. We are far from Petrograd and no support arrives to us. If we are to hope to build up a power base and go re-establish Russian rule in the Caucasus we need more men to work with. Only an expansion of conscription laws can solve this issue though. As unpopular as it may be."
ASY_fair_land_redistribution:0 "Fair Land Redistribution"
ASY_fair_land_redistribution_desc:0 "Now that we have finally re-conquered lands that rightfully belong to the Assyrian nation, we must make sure that our people are able to return. In order to do so, we must implement a new policy of fair land redistribution. Fair to the Assyrian people of course. This land is ours after all. Why should we share it with these imperialists who have no right to be here in the first place?"
ASY_form_the_hakkari_arsenal:0 "Form The Hakkari Arsenal"
ASY_form_the_hakkari_arsenal_desc:0 "The state of our military is poor to say the least. Most of our men don’t even have shoes on their feet! Let alone guns! If we were to be invaded, it is hard to admit, we would be crushed. To remedy this, we shall create an arsenal in the state of Hakkari. A series of massive factories that shall supply our armies with everything they may need."
ASY_found_the_assyrian_academy_of_sciences:0 "Found The Assyrian Academy of Sciences"
ASY_found_the_assyrian_academy_of_sciences_desc:0 "If we are to stay ahead of any potential rivals and competitors, whether it be the cunning Persians, the Eternal Anglo or the warmongering Turk, we must be sure to keep up in technology and have every advantage that we can have, both for our military and our industry."
ASY_gad_wins:0 "GAD Wins"
ASY_gad_wins_desc:0 "The results have come in from the election, and the result is a resounding victory for the Conservative GAD. With Yusuf Malek being sworn in and pledging to serve the will of the Assyrian people earlier today, Assyria seems set on a bright future."
ASY_gsa_wins:0 "GSA Wins"
ASY_gsa_wins_desc:0 "The results of the election have confirmed a victory for the underdog party. One that most people expected to retain a respectable amount of seats but still lose to the Conservative GAD party. It appears that the Assyrian people have tired of oligarchic theocracies, so much so that the ideals of reform and progression have won out among them. Let us look to a brighter, more equal future for the Assyrian people!"
ASY_help_the_poor:0 "Help The Poor"
ASY_help_the_poor_desc:0 "As it was said by the Patriarchs of old, from Basil of Caesarea to even Jesus Christ. The poor and the poverty stricken are those that must be assisted by us if we are to set an example for all others to march on into the divine Kingdom of God.  Those who are hungry we shall give me food to eat. Those who are thirsty, we shall give drink. To those who are strangers, we shall take in. To those who are naked, we shall clothe. Those who are sick, we shall visit. And those who are in prison, we shall come to."
ASY_his_holiness_is_dead:0 "His Holiness is Dead"
ASY_his_holiness_is_dead_desc:0 "Tragedy has struck our beloved nation of Assyria today as our beloved holiness Benyamen XIX Shimun has unfortunately passed away and a council of both parishes, priests and politicians have got together and announced a state of mourning for the nation."
ASY_holy_rule_is_secured:0 "Holy Rule is Secured"
ASY_holy_rule_is_secured_desc:0 "Under the leadership of our dear Patriarch Shimun, Assyria has come far. Our situation now is far more advanced than what it used to be. Political stability has returned even if we did need to get our hands a little dirty, the issue of Kurdish separatism has been largely solved and Assyria seems set to march onto a new and prosperous future under the watch of our Lord God."
ASY_import_artillery:0 "Import Artillery"
ASY_import_artillery_desc:0 "Artillery is far harder to make than mere guns, and requires resources which we do not have much of. The most effective solution to this issue is to look outside yet again. Let us import the essential resource for our army that is artillery and in doing so bolster our forces to be many leagues greater than what they used to be."
ASY_incorporate_tribal_militias:0 "Incorporate Tribal Militias"
ASY_incorporate_tribal_militias_desc:0 "A not insignificant number of men that could be in the armies are instead part of Tribal militias. It would be unwise however to take away these men and force them into our ranks, a revolt is the last thing we need. So we shall instead opt a more moderate route. We shall negotiate with tribal leaders. In exchange for prestige and wealth, their marauding bands shall be incorporated into our armed forces and trained to be a capable and professional army."
ASY_invest_in_agriculture:0 "Invest in Agriculture"
ASY_invest_in_agriculture_desc:0 "The land of Assyria is not the best land to grow crops. Certainly a far cry from the fertile soil of the Tigris and the Euphrates that we used to control. One shudders to imagine how desperate and devastating the situation would surely become if the rain did not come for too long. To counter this dreadful hypothetical, we shall sink some money into the agrarian population of Assyria."
ASY_invite_the_russian_capitalists:0 "Invite Russian Capitalists"
ASY_invite_the_russian_capitalists_desc:0 "Our country is in dire need of foreign investments, and it would certainly seem that Russian businessmen are the men for the job. Most have grown concerned with the situation in Russia not thinking it to be a particularly profitable region for the time being due to the turbulent politics of the country. But we shall show them that in Assyria, there is nothing but opportunity!"
ASY_liberate_the_homeland:0 "Liberate The Homeland"
ASY_liberate_the_homeland_desc:0 "The treachery and cunning of other scheming nations have led to us becoming little more than a rump state. How can we be able to call ourselves Assyrians if we do not even control the heartlands of the Assyrian nation? We must beat back the pretenders and usurpers for the sake of our people!"
ASY_make_concessions_to_the_british_companies:0 "Make Concessions to The British Companies"
ASY_make_concessions_to_the_british_companies_desc:0 "The undisputed hegemon of the Middle East is without a doubt the British and their colonial empire. If we are to succeed, it’d be good to get on good terms with them. Thus, let us make some concessions to British companies so that we may see some investment coming into our countries. Some may not like foreign economic domination, but that is simply the price we must pay."
ASY_make_concessions_to_tribal_leaders:0 "Make Concessions to Tribal Leaders"
ASY_make_concessions_to_tribal_leaders_desc:0 "We cannot say that we could have gotten to where we are without assistance from tribal leaders and chieftains. What kind of a friend would we be if we did not show our thanks to them? In return for their votes and assistance to us. Let us grant them privileges. Some may complain, but it is simply the price we must pay to be the good neighbours that we all must one day become."
ASY_mother_russia_greets_her_sons:0 "Mother Russia Greets Her Sons"
ASY_mother_russia_greets_her_sons_desc:0 "At long last. Our struggle and bondage is at an end. We have liberated the lands that so rightfully belong to the Russian Empire and brought them back into her warm embrace. Our mission is complete. May this be a dawn of great prosperity for all of the Caucaisan people!"
ASY_mountaineers_of_assyria:0 "Montaineers of Assyria"
ASY_mountaineers_of_assyria_desc:0 "The land that we are limited to for now is filled with mountains and valleys. Some of the hardest terrain to fight in. Fortunately, this gives us a fantastic chance to train our men for future conflicts where we may need to fight in the mountains. Let us not risk getting bogged down in the future and risking the lives of more men than is necessary."
ASY_negotiate_with_tribal_leaders:0 "Negotiate With Tribal Leaders"
ASY_negotiate_with_tribal_leaders_desc:0 "The matter of self-determination and independence from Assyria by the Kurds has been a long standing issue of the Assyrian nation. However, by sitting down and negotiating with Kurdish tribal leaders and promising political concessions and autonomy we can hope to lower discontent and demands for independence among them."
ASY_new_patriarch_is_elected:0 "New Patriarch is Elected"
ASY_new_patriarch_is_elected_desc:0 "As expected, the people have wisely chosen to elect the Patriarch Shimun XXI Eshai. Now that the war over Hakkari is over and done with, we can turn to running the country as normal and finishing the plans and reforms planned by upper members of the clergy that this country so desperately needs."
ASY_pacify_the_country_side:0 "Pacify The Country-side"
ASY_pacify_the_country_side_desc:0 "The restoration of Russian rule in Assyria has not been news that many have welcomed. Most resistance has come from Kurdish tribes seeking to establish their independence, but reports of Arabs, Assyrians and Turks rioting in response to the news have been coming in non stop. Needless to say, we cannot continue like this and must take radical action to unseat the hold of the nationalist mind."
ASY_proclaim_equality_of_all_citizens:0 "Proclaim Equality of All Citizens"
ASY_proclaim_equality_of_all_citizens_desc:0 "It’d be a lie to say that Assyria was a particularly inclusive nation before Petros’s coup against the reactionary and oppressive oligarchy that ruled over Assyria for so long. But this state of affairs shall be no more. Assyria shall not elevate the standing of any one group over any other. From now on, in the eyes of the government and in the eyes of the law all citizens of Assyria shall be equal. Wether they are Christian, Muslim, Kurd, Turk, Arab, rich, poor, male, female. It shall not matter. Assyria shall become the guiding light of the East. The light it was always meant to be!"
ASY_progressive_taxation:0 "Progrssive Taxation"
ASY_progressive_taxation_desc:0 "Within our country, 1% of the population controls as much as 80% of its wealth. The vast inequality corrupting our beautiful state has been somewhat mitigated by our moves to socialise the Assyrian land. But this can only go so far. These oligarchs will still control great amounts of wealth even if the land is owned by the people. Thus to counter their oppressive hold on society we shall establish new tax rates. The poorer the man, the less he shall pay in taxes and the richer the man the more he shall give to society, instead of growing fat off of the labour of those beneath him."
ASY_promote_conversion_of_muslims:0 "Promote Conversion Among Muslims"
ASY_promote_conversion_of_muslims_desc:0 "As it was said in the Holy Bible: “Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”"
ASY_put_end_to_the_kavkazs_madness:0 "Put an End to The Kavkaz Madness"
ASY_put_end_to_the_kavkazs_madness_desc:0 "The greatest military threat was without a doubt the Armenian state. But ideologically speaking, the madness that rules in the Kavkaz society is far more twisted and dangerous to us. Luckily, we can be happy in knowing that they will likely not be able to put up much of a fight. But we should not let this fact get the better of us. They have the mountains to rely on after all. Thus, let us see to it that we remain vigilant, and reclaim our rightful territory."
ASY_reorganize_the_caucasian_voluntary_army:0 "Re-organize The Caucasian Volunteer Army"
ASY_reorganize_the_caucasian_voluntary_army_desc:0 "It has been decades since our brave men have seen combat. Many of course remember the training and experiences they saw through the War and violent breakup of the middle east. But if we are to successfully pull off our endeavour, we must re-organise our men into a horde of professional and elite troops!"
ASY_republic_is_proclaimed:0 "The Republic is Proclaimed"
ASY_republic_is_proclaimed_desc:0 "It appears that the goals of Agha Petros have not been as malicious as some have feared. Not long after the introduction of Martial Law, Petros has started to take steps towards liberalisation and the proclamation of a free Republic, ruled not by oligarchs and priests but by the people!"
ASY_request_help_from_russia:0 "Request Help From Russia"
ASY_request_help_from_russia_desc:0 "Assyria is not exactly the country in the greatest position for a re-conquest of the caucasus. But we must work with what we have, even if it is not much. Of course, we can use who we are to convince our brothers in Moscow to send some guns and aid over to us to try and make the situation a little more bearable."
ASY_return_baku:0 "Return to Baku"
ASY_return_baku_desc:0 "Now that we have wrestled control over Armenia we have been able to successfully march into the fields of Azerbaijan. It was at first surprising that the Azeri population welcomed our men as they entered Baku and their fields. The reality of the situation set in when we discovered the acts of depravity and terror enforced by the Armenian state on the Azeri nation. The Azeri people are thus happy to be under the rule of an entity that does not seek their extermination. We can at least be happy about one thing then, that the integration of Azerbaijan will be far easier."
ASY_return_that_is_ours:0 "Return That Which Is Ours"
ASY_return_that_is_ours_desc:0 "We would be hypocrites if we unjustly attacked those lands which we have no business in. We must restrain ourselves to liberating our fellow Assyrians abroad. We shall be the bogger men and stay above these leeches and thieves."
ASY_russian_advisors:0 "Russian Advisors"
ASY_russian_advisors_desc:0 "The Russian Army was one of the most feared and strongest forces of the Great War. If our armies were to be trained by their commanders and generals, we surely would become a formidable force too!"
ASY_secularize_the_state:0 "Secularize The State"
ASY_secularize_the_state_desc:0 "As long as political power and influence is held by the clergy and the estate of the Church, we cannot hope to truly be a democratic state. We cannot become a democracy in name only, where our political candidates are little more than mouthpieces for the clergy, where individual churches and priests command their “flock” to vote for this or that political party, irrespective of their own individual beliefs. Thus, we must make sure that the Church and the State are separated. Our laws shall not be governed by any religious text and the churches shall not dominate our government! We shall be a beacon of democracy in a region filled with reactionaries and despots!"

There has been some opposition to this movement who have cited the recent uprising by Kurdish militias and groups as a reason for them to not be allowed to vote in the election as they have so far only worked against Assyria."

asy.1.title:0 "It Was Night"
asy.1.desc:0 "In the darkest night that a Middle-Easterner mountain nation could have, specifically in the historical center of Hakkari, therein sat the young, yet ancient, Nation's leader; His Holiness Mar Shimun XIX Benyamin, Patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East, a religious man devoted to his Church and Nation his whole life, narrowly escaping death from Kurdish nationalists in the south and by Turkish revanchists in the north - he had always been in the edge of death and life. Now, at 59, he looked outside the local Government building, functioning from an old Assyrian church within city ruins, drinking some black tea - even if the time was not right, Benyamin felt like he wouldn't be able to taste it next morning. And so, as he looked at the great Moon in the cold night, the Son of Man came down unto the Heavens in two natures, clouds descending from the Night sky and slowly, gently revealing his hands which showed the two wounds of Christ. In His veils, Benyamin was placed, and slowly brought out of the patio he was in, and so like that, nothing else mattered. The bliss felt at the edge of life as he reached Heaven's Gate was unparallaled, and so he opened his eyes, as he reached for Heaven. He could not even hear anything with the exception of wonderful angelical singing from the great Cherubs of the skies, which from their ancient thrones unto the gate of Heaven sung for His Holiness Benyamin to come forward and join them in God's Kingdom."
asy.1.a:0 "\"Your Holiness, are you alright?\""
asy.2.title:0 "After the Quiet, therein came Violence"
asy.2.desc:0 "His Holiness' Mar Shimun XIX Benyamin passed away peacefully, and so with him went away any sense of stability in Assyria. Kurdish nationalists, Russian soldiers, Turkish Turanists, Assyrian Theocrats and Democrats, all battle out for control of power in our small fledging nation. Subsequently, it all came to a head today as various forces attempted a raid on the Provisional Government of Assyria led by Shimun XXI Eshai, resulting in a near state of Civil War where all of Assyria is participating. So, as the country sits on a knife's edge, who will gain the great push?"
asy.2.a:0 "The Assyrian Church of the East's militias repel the raids!"
asy.2.b:0 "Democrats within the provisional government stage a Coup and end the war!"
asy.2.c:0 "The Russian veterans are victorious!"
asy.3.title:0 "Ancient Traditions"
asy.3.desc:0 "\"And so, with the passing of one to the Kingdom of Heaven, comes another to represent Assyria in it's greatest time of need,\" said Shimun XXI Eshai, slowly sitting down on the Assyrian Church of the East's temporary temporal throne, seeking to express his desire to maintain Benyamin's calls for unity of the Assyrian national idea, and maintain their traditions and lifestyles. Subsequently, various anxious, yet relieved religious figures hailing from Russia to the United States have arrived to the convention, showing great solidarity among the Assyrian diaspora and local communities. And so, as Shimun XXI Eshai sat down on the throne, he was given the Temporal Scepter of the Assyrian Church of the East, alongside the needed clothes. And as he gave a silent prayer to everyone in the room, and more widely, everyone in Hakkari (this was the first radio-broadcasted event in much of Hakkari), he was given the title of His Holiness."
asy.3.a:0 "Welcome, Your Holiness."
asy.4.title:0 "Temporary Martial Law"
asy.4.desc:0 "Betrayal! Within the ranks of soldiers, many idealized a great shining democracy in Assyria, free from the tyranny of clergy. Subsequently, with the help of democrats of all sides within the Government who pulled off a coup, many soldiers including Agha Petros decided to participate in this coup as the military side, which subsequently was given all the power for a temporary period to purge all enemies of the fledging democracy. While some would suspect eternal martial law, Agha Petros promises that he will give in to all democratic forces in the country in due time."
asy.4.a:0 "And so, the Middle East gains a democracy."
asy.5.title:0 "Holy Russia Returns"
asy.5.desc:0 "And so, with all these populist forces around the country formerly known as Assyria causing chaos and resulting in tyranny from the majority, it is clear that only through the guidance of Holy Russia and her great Petrogadschina we can save the Caucasus as a whole from ruin and division. We must think in ways greater than ourselves - in ways of union, in ways of progress and yet of tradition. Thusly, the Caucasus Brigade, pledging allegiance to the Russian Empire, has seized Hakkari and shall begin efforts to re-create the Caucasian General Governorate which was dissolved after the various declarations of independence that occured during the 1920s and 1910s. No longer - we shall go on in our crusade to re-establish our great Governorate in total subservience to the Russian Empire, and to Kolchak. Kolchak will bring us to the future, and we will help Holy Russia with oil and other resources!"
asy.5.a:0 "For our Holy Empire!"
asy.6.title:0 "Give Kurds the vote?"
asy.6.desc:0 "Kurds are a very large number of our population, although not the majority fortunately. Many liberals and social democrats especially in our country have said that it is an insult to our birthing democracy that we won't give them the vote, but many conservatives say that giving non-Assyrians the vote would be expanding too much what it means to be Assyrian, and subsequently resulting in actual Assyrian voices being muddled by Kurdish people. What shall be done by our military government?"
asy.6.a:0 "What works, works. Don't give them the vote."
asy.6.b:0 "Kurds are our nationals, they deserve it."
asy.7.title:0 "First Assyrian Elections"
asy.7.desc:0 "As we go forward transitioning away from military regime to proper civilian Government, we have reached the first time many Assyrians have heard of the idea of voting, and so it has become quite the challenge to ensure that everyone in the country votes properly. Regardless, it has gone relatively well, with a 65 percent turnout across the country. Regardless, only one can come out on top, and so, the votes have been counted - and the party that has won is..."
asy.7.a:0 "The Conservative GAD!"
asy.7.b:0 "The Social Democratic GSA!"
asy.8.title:0 "Treaty of Yerevan"
asy.8.desc:0 "As the world is plunged into chaos, there is some small solace to be found in the co-operation between christian nations in the caucasus. Armenia and Assyria are natural allies, with Armenian support, we may allow ourselves some security against potential enemies in the region that seek to undo the hard work of our people."
asy.8.a:0 "Fellow Christians stand together."
asy.8.b:0 "Establish a closer kinship."
