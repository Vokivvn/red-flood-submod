#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
POLITICS_KERENSKY_DESC:0 "Though many have tried, none have been able to remove Kerensky from power. Although him and his party have promised freedom and democracy to Zheltorossiya, many have taken notice of his unwillingness to resign as president, and fear he may further consolidate his power. Regardless, Kerensky is intent on carrying out the Russian Revolution, no matter what it takes."
POLITICS_GASTEV_DESC:0 "Given his extensive background of revolutionary activity, trade union activism, and advocacy for scientific economic management, Alexei Gastev was the perfect candidate for the Soviets on paper. However, only Gastev knew then what his true plans were. To transform Russia, and soon the world, into his final work of art. A realm of humanity's next evolution, Homo Metallum, guided entirely by scientific management. Gastev sees the proposal of planned economies as too moderate, instead proposing a planned society. And seeing as his plans are already in motion, it seems little will stand into the way…"
POLITICS_ALISA_DESC:0 "Rosenbaum, like many other ideological radicals, fled to Zheltorossiya following the victory of the Whites in the Russian Civil War. However, unlike most of her compatriots, Rosenbaum has no issues with Russia's capitalist economy. Rather, the authoritarian regime of Kolchak has pushed her towards a radical form of liberalism, one in which freedom and the market take absolute primacy. The question remains, can Russia be bought by Rosenbaum, or will she have to fight for a new Russian Republic?"
POLITICS_MILYUKOV:0 "Longtime leader of the Kadets, Milyukov is a new arrival to Zheltorossiya, as reformist liberals were only recently ousted from the Russian regime. Now seeing the faults in negotiating with power-mad tyrants, Milyukov aims to reconcile with the revolutionaries of 1905 and 1917 in order to reignite the flame of democratic rebellion in Russia."
POLITICS_SPIRIDONOVA_DESC:0 "In a stunning turn of fate, Maria Spiridonova has managed to take power, bringing Anarcho-syndicalism to Russia. Distrusting of both authoritarian socialist ideologies and social democracy, Spiridonova aims to create a new Russian society with a stateless federation of trade unions. She also aims to mix the Soviet Feminist ideas of Alexandra Kollontai with Anarchist philosophy."
POLITICS_BOLDYREV_DESC:0 "Vasily Boldyrev is a military commander in the Russian army who has managed to seize power in Zheltorossiya. Just like most Russian warlords, Boldyrev has little ambition, and merely swears fealty to whoever controls the seat of power in Russia. He does, however, plan on bringing Russian values and governance to the remote region."
POLITICS_TROTSKY_DESC:0 "A former Internationalist general and prospective heir to Vladimir Lenin, Trotsky has been forced to continue waging the Russian Civil War from Zheltorossiya. However, in his exile, Trotsky has managed to rally with former Mensheviks to form a new radical wing of the RSDRP. It was this clique that easily won over the Zheltorossiyan peasantry and proletariat with promises of radicalization of socialist reforms and protection from famines and anarchist chaos. However, few know of Trotsky's true ambition: to restore the Soviet Union and shape it in his own ideological image."
POLITICS_KAMENEV_DESC:0 "A former ally of Leon Trotsky, Kamenev has taken leadership of the party on a Council Communist platform. Kamenev seeks to emulate the German Revolution, with his long-term goal being to create a federal union of council republics in Russia and its imperial territories. While managing to secure wide support among the people and party, radicals of all stripes have denounced him and presumably begun plotting against him."
POLITICS_DAN_DESC:0 "Originally a founding member of the Mensheviks, Fyodor Dan abandoned revolutionary parties altogether after their failure to bring socialism to Russia. Now, Dan sees cooperation with the RSDRP as the only effective means of opposing the Kolchakocracy. With Kolchak's downfall, they hope to implement a form of agrarian socialism more suited to the Russian peasantry."
POLITICS_CHAPAYEV_DESC:0 "A radical Anarchist general in Kerensky's army, Chapayev saw an opportunity in the political turmoil surrounding the famines in Zheltorossiya. The people were suffering, and they cried out in anger at a government which had failed to deliver on its promises. The people demanded justice, and as Chapayev listened to their cries, he resolved to give it to them. But he realized something else, too. No one can truly be trusted with the people's freedom. No one, that is, except the people themselves. Chapayev's military experience has thus far equipped him to protect his chaotic realm, but only time can tell how long the fragile peace will last."
POLITICS_AVKSENTIEV_DESC:0 "Nikolai Avksentiev has come out on top of the triumvirate along with the PSR faction with a plan of socialization and agrarian socialism. Although sharing the same party, Avksentiev has decided to distance himself from Boris Savinkov in Belarus, and aims to rebrand the party."

Even with its disnfuntional system that has allowed the rise of all kinds of extremists, Zheltorossiya is still a beacon of democracy in East Asia, but for how much longer?"

ZHR.1.t:0 "The Liquidator"
ZHR.1.desc:0 "Recently, the People's Committee for Entertainment produced a hit motion picture for The One State, to be shown in every factory. \n\nThe motion picture, called \"The Liquidator\", is set in a far future where capitalist reaction still lingers in America. The reationaries attempt to destroy the glorious, mechanised One State that fully embraced Comrade Gastev's idea of mechanical, automatic socialism, where workers no longer trouble themselves administrating the country leaving it to machines. In the motion picture, Anglo-American reaction tries everything to stop the people's mechanisation of the world, even inventing time machines to kill Comrade Gastev. However, the One State sends a brave mechanical son of The State to save the Soviet Utopia. \n\nThe Liquidator, a robot made using the brain of a heroic fallen Soviet soldier, hunts down the agents of international capitalism, sacrificing himself in the climax of the tale, achieving the final victory.\n\nThe motion picture ends with the One State beginning to travel to the stars, facing the new danger of extraterrestrial life."

ZHR.2.t:0 "The Ultimatum"
ZHR.2.desc:0 "Kerensky has often proclaimed to care for the people. \n\n However, his willful inaction has caused the famine in Zheltorossiya, resulting in thousands dying of starvation. After a perfect storm of droughts, improper infrastructure, and lack of government action has resulted in an absolutely horrific situation where Zheltorossiya is near complete collapse. The Supreme Soviet of Harbin has subsequently sent an ultimatum to Kerensky demanding him to resign immediately, and give power to the Soviet to decide the future of Zheltorossiya in an emergency council which will seek to deal with the famine as soon as possible. And so, after receiving the note, Kerensky looks from his window at his home in Harbin, and..."
ZHR.2.a:0 "...decides to resign."
ZHR.2.b:0 "...demands the Supreme Soviet resign."

ZHR.3.t:0 "The Resignation"
ZHR.3.desc:0 "Kerensky has resigned. \n\n After quickly realizing that none of the Supreme Soviet was on his side, and that his position would not afford him any safety, Kerensky proclaimed that new elections should be held and that the future of the Russian Republic hangs in the balance. He has ceremonially given the reigns of power to the vacant seat in Harbin, and taken his things from the Soviet President's Office to a hotel, staying there for the next week. Subsequently, various groups in the Russian Republic vye for power, including military cliques that believe in various transformations of Russian society. The Right-Kadets would be the likely winners of any election as many people were completely disillusioned by Kerensky's SRs and demand capitalist freedom. However, an increasingly large group of people led by utopian socialists such as Aleksei Gastev and Lev Kamenev believe in pursuing socialist principles more strongly, rejecting Kerensky's moderate approach. They do not believe that now is the time for elections, instead action must be taken by the Soviets, with the next President selected by politics and not plebicite. The authoritarian streak to Gastev leaves many uneasy, but the centre-left parties seem unlikely to resolve their bickering long enough to undercut Kerensky and take the leading role in Government.\n\n As stated before, the fate of the Russian Republic lies in the balance..."

ZHR.4.desc:0 "'Order has been restored in the Republic.' \n\n The speech given by the soldiers in the Supreme Soviet was brief, but nescessary as many members of the Supreme Soviet were afraid of a potential purge, and many citizens were afraid of there being another civil war. Eventually however, the military took over every single outpost in the country, every single city, and eventually most minor villages and slowly began the proccess of restoring order in the rest of the country, as they create an Emergency Committe to decide what shall be the future of the Republic. Almost all of the Army is extremely political, but in very different ways - some are anarchists, like Chapayev and his cadre, who believe the Republic should be dissolved and turned into an Anarchist commonwealth based on principles of peasant freedom and force against aristocracy. Other elements side with the Military Commissar of Vladivostok, a newly re-established position, led by Boldyrev, who believes that Kolchak is far too powerful to be fought against, and that the Russian Republic should be dissolved and turned back into a part of the Russian Empire in exchange for extensive autonomy grants, something Kolchak and his allies already grant to most of Russia anyways. The rest of the Army sides with Trotsky, an aggressive internationalist who believes in retaking the Motherland at all costs and ensuring that the ideals of Lenin are never perverted by people like Aleksei Gastev. One faction, after extensive fighting, bickering, and sectarianism has finally risen up and taken over most of the garissons, effectively ensuring they have taken power in the Russian Republic. This being..."

ZHR.5.desc:0 "After Kerensky's resignation, it appears that the Soviet has appointed Lev Kamenev as the new Premier of the Russian Republic, his socialist platform saw his 'Tsentr' party in and out of government coalitions and vote pacts for the last few years. Now he leads the Soviets forwards, but all is not well. The appointment may be a convincing win for the socialists, but internal disagreements over policy and political allies in the fractured congress is leading to rumours of a move to replace Kamenev. Whether the OLN, SRs or IPK will be ones to do it remains to be seen, for now, Kamenev has set about the famine relief efforts and reorganising the bureaucracy to serve the regional soviets instead of Harbin. \"It is time for action, it is time for the Soviets to serve the people once more, as was always intended with our revolution, together we will see the Republic into it's bright future. No ambitious officers or capitalist traitors will stop the people's justice being brought to Russia. Long live the Republic.\"\n"

ZHR.502.desc:0 "The OLN have been minor players in the Republic's politics for most of its history, but its numbers have swollen recently. Defectors from the other socialist parties as well as the attraction of a decentralised republic to the ethnic minorities has made strange bedfellows of the faction's members. They are all however, equally captivated by the party leader, Maria Spiridonova. A long-time socialist activist, her tales of resistance to Tsarist brutality, abuse even, has won the hearts of many over the years. Her writings frequent leftist publications throughout the Russo-phile world (where they are not banned at least) and her tour of the Republic in 1926 helped bring some much needed morale to the people. Her leadership is decisive, but comes with a soft touch, with compassion and conviction in equal measure."

ZHR.503.desc:0 "Like an old dog Lev Kamenev has refused the new blood of the Republic a chance to flex their muscle, the guidance of the RSDLP saw the Republic through dark days in the 20s and so it shall do so once more. Gastev's arrest sent a warning sign to would-be usurpers and traitors, now the minor socialists are falling in line, open criticism remains, but no longer is Mr. Kamenev's post at risk. His party have enough overall control in the Soviets now that the IPK has been all but dissolved. President Kamenev concluded his first public address (a firey and passionate ideological monologue it was too) with the phrase \"Let us get to work.\""

ZHR.504.t:0 "The Triumvirate Forms"
ZHR.504.desc:0 "Kamenev's decision to co-operate with minor parties signals a tide shift in the Republic's politics, at last a bloc of compromise has formed, a moderate socialist position, both popular and stable enough to govern now esists. Mr. Kamenev will not hold high office, but he is still influential and his party is one of the three that now form the Government. In his stead the leadership of the Republic will now fall to either Fyodor Dan or Nikolai Avksentiev. Though the agreement has yet to be signed, both have pledged to the Triumvirate's new program of reform."
ZHR.504.a:0 "Cool heads have prevailed."

ZHR.505.t:0 "Gastev Addresses the Republic"
ZHR.505.desc:0 "Upon the resignation of Mr. Kamenev, a strange thing occurred. At the direction of the IPK, several military units encircled the Government district in Harbin. A coup, surely? Hours passed, and nothing happened, then a radio broadcast began. It began with a song, instrumental, played on piano with a strange ticking sound harmonising often with the din. After some minutes a shot rang out over a silent Harbin and the voice of Alexei Gastev came over the airwaves. Far from the reassuring voice of a strong leader, Gastev introduced himself almost timidly. He proclaimed the IPK's collective leadership of the Republic, he laid out an ultimatum to the opposition to abandon their efforts at seizing power from the appointed President. He then named a long list of \"traitors\", his voice was calm and rythmic. He intonated as though he were reading a story book. Once the list was completed, he spoke of the great collective designs of the Proletkult, the great plans for the Republic and the role every single person had to play in the great future of the revolution. Here his calm voice seemed almost passionless, political rhetoric with quiet conviction and no pompous rousing. He ended his speech by declaring (again in an unnatural calm) that there was no longer room for the bickering and deviance of the past, that the republic could only survive if each person fulfilled their role in the great machinery of life, that they must all become \"We.\""
ZHR.505.a:0 "WE!"

ZHR.6.t:0 "Long Live The Dollar"

After hundreds of thousands of Russians, Han, and Manchurians felt incredibly disillusioned by Kerensky's policies, they supported his resignation whole-heartedly. In spite of his shortcomings and anti-democratic tendencies, many knew that he was an important part of Russian history and a good President, or at least used to be. No worries now, however, as the Right-Kadets have been elected and Pavel Milyukov has come to power in the Republic, quickly getting to work in making a rousing and powerful speech about human freedom and the reforms planned to empower the people. Alisa Rosenbaum - leader of a radical faction within the Kadets - has been tasked with overseeing the reforms, but her ideological persistence is giving Milyukov a headache just days into the job. She has been making such outrageous demands as the abolition of taxes and the disbandment of multiple government agencies, even the police. It seems that soon one of them will go, though it is not yet clear which of them it will be."

A large, towering building looking over the city, it was commissioned by Rosembaum for unknown reasons, and a press conference was held in a room overlooking the building to discuss the reasons behind the construction of this building. After everything came down, she came out and delivered a speech on it.\n“This building, this shining beacon within our city, is a testament to the new Russia which we are creating today. But not because it stands there. See, this is a very nice building, but it has a fatal flaw. It was built by the state; not by an innovator or a great mind, but by government contracts and government employees. And so…” One of her bodyguards took out a TNT plunger and handed it to her, which she quickly pressed. In seconds, the building was set ablaze by explosions from all over the building. The crowd gasped and some even cried as the building fell to the earth, leaving a cloud of smoke and plaster hovering in the air.\n“If you expect the state to handout great works of art, you are a parasite. This government exists to defend property, and that is it. Otherwise, you are on your own, because this world only tolerates the mighty few, and not the pathetic many.” She quickly exited the room, as the press corps was left in shock."

ZHR.20.desc:0 "Trying to make an army on Alisa Rosenbaum's principles was not as difficult as first thought. At first, it was believed that trying to enforce those principles would be disastrous, because warfare needs selfless devotion to duty and one's comrades to survive; the opposite of what Objectivism has preached. So, how the hell do you run it like that? Turns out, it was quite simple; run the army like a business!\nThink of it like this; every officer is like a boss in the workplace, who answer to higher ups and have to manage the workers. Sure, they're lazy parasites, but we do need someone to do the dirty work. The same goes with the army; the chain of command must think of themselves not as selfless devotees to a cause, because that reeks of socialism. Rather, they will think of themselves as innovators and capitalists, proud in their abilities and strengths and showing only contempt for those who oppose them. Similarly, privates and lower ranked soldiers shall have to prove their worth, and if they don't, they're out. Goodbye!\nThis army shall be a perfect demonstration of our principles in practice. Capitalism shall exist in every sphere of life, and nothing shall be able to escape it. Truly, we have found the most rational system of life and politics to ever be discovered."

The Revolutionary Army is committed to his ideals, and all of Russia shall experience his true glory. Hail Kerensky! Hail the republic! A speech he gave earlier today in front of the Directorate has solidified the people's faith in him. “The leader in a republic,'' he said, “must not merely be a parliamentary figure, but the unifier of all its citizens. Russia is composed of many kinds of people, and both the Tsar, the Internationalists and the Kolchak government only drove a wedge in between them. But we are all Russians, stretching from Petrograd to Vladivostok, and they can be unified by a common national identity and a leader whom they respect and adore. The people have willed me into office, and thus I am their sword and shield! They adore their elected officials like they would God himself, and this is not sacrosanct, but holy!”\nHis statements in today's meeting has been criticized by some as being authoritarian and resembling more the dictatorship in France than a true republican government. But He, that representation of the republic's ideals, shall strike down these fools and traitors, and the Russian nation shall rise once more. "

Republican values must be defended through the pen as well as the sword, and this includes posters, music, and of course, radio. Testing the new program, Kerensky gave a speech today on the evils of Bolshevism and the necessity to crush it.\n“Radicals, anarchists, Marxists; they are all the same. They seek to destroy what we have built here in favour of a regimented dictatorship. They hate our republic, and wish to subjugate you to the worst kinds of slavery and terror. I shall not allow it; every Internationalist terrorist and his ilk will be put to the sword or the spade! They shall either work for you or die for you! Your liberty is dependent upon their subjugation or their destruction. Make no mistake citizens, for while this may seem cruel, it is mercy. For they would do far, far worse if they had even a single finger upon a pistol. We know how this song and dance ends; you have all read about what has happened in Germany after their revolution, or the fate of the generals in Hungary, or the current sufferings of the Brazillian people. This shall not happen here.”\n“Me and the Directorate shall represent and defend you at every cost. The Russian fatherland must be governed not with mere talk, but with a firm hand and a steadfast march. Kolchak, Trotsky, Drozdovsky; all shall be thrown out of this country. The new Republican Russia shall rise forth and liberate the world from tyranny! We are the standard bearers of an order never before seen! The chains shall be thrown off, and the people shall stand victorious!”"

As he let his head lay on the pillow of his bed, Kerensky felt exhausted from the constant work. Sleep was the only time he could sit down and relax. Truly, he was a martyr, suffering on the behalf of the Russian people; at least, that's what he thought.\nBut as he drifted off into slumber, he saw the most wonderful thing. He saw a map of the current world, but it started to move and change. Kingdoms and empires became republics, the accelerationist governments fell into disarray, and the Internationalist menace in Berlin toppled. It was a world of fraternal republics, and it was beautiful. Kerensky realized his purpose in that moment; it wasn't just to save Russia, but to bring about the End of History. His republic was the final form that all other powers would emulate; the radical changes and uprisings of years past would be replaced with slow and steady reform and change. These republics, lead by a Directorate and a powerful leader, could save the world.\nKerensky had a greater purpose than ever before. His armies and strength would plunge into darkness and come out victorious, cutting of the heads of Bolshevism and monarchism. Fraternal republics would stand free and sovereign once more! When he woke from his slumber, he knew what he was. As Nietzsche said"

According to Kerensky, the new army's job is to spread the ideals of democracy and republican government to Russia and the entire world. To serve Russia, the soldier must be loyal to Kerensky, the Directorate and the people, and must be selfless in their service to the nation. They must keep themselves detached from all political parties, and should only have the nation in mind when they charge into battle, and not just some foreign ideology exported from France or Berlin.\nKerensky evoked the role of the Levée en masse of the French Revolution when speaking about the nature of the new army. “Thousand were conscripted to serve, and in spite of everything, they won. The monarchist dogs were repelled and France was saved. We are in the same spot, and thus, require the same dedication and willingness to serve. Otherwise, we shall perish!”"

Multiple government officials in Harbin and around the country have been kidnapped or vanished, and while some of their captors have come forth with demands, it seems many simply met the mob’s pitchforks.\n Our gracious efforts to bring this nation to greatness have backfired. Our decision to withhold aid from the countryside following the drought was not met with stoic courage and acceptance as expected but with petulant rebellion and non-cooperation. Urban garbage and rural hayseeds alike now wander about town spouting off about how much more sensibly and compassionately they could govern. Most economic activity in our capital has been brought to a standstill as people mill around and make scenes in public as if the whole city were their tavern, while fattening themselves on looted surplus.\n Emboldened by watching our policemen gradually desert, rioters are now shouting to the remaining officials holed up in halls of government that they must give themselves up or be burned alive inside. Perhaps we let the writhing worm that is our populous starve for too long, perhaps we should have disciplined it better, but it is too late for all that. After a few suicides most government men submit and are subjected to public humiliation. Our agricultural minister was dismembered, forced to watch his limbs be buried and watered with his blood as if they were being propagated, and asked if he now saw the benefit of resuming farming subsidies. Another crazed mob got a hold of our economic minister and gave him a less poetic, more pagan death of being burned alive in a wicker man."
